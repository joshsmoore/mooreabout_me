# Assembly, Art creation for Engineers

I came across [Assembly](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/assembly-graphic-design-for/) a couple of days ago, and I love it.  Before I say more, I should tell you a little bit more about myself.  I am an engineer with no artistic talent.  You have to take my word on this one *no* artistic talent.  But, I have always loved the idea of drawing, photography, and other forms of visual creation.  However, I have never taken the time to learn, and when I have, I have always been disappointed with the results (once again no artistic talent here).  But, I started using Assembly and within a single day I had created a picture that I like.

I know this is a simple start, and I know I am not the next Picassa.  But, for me to be able to create this in a matter of hours and I like the result, it is like a masterpiece.  Well, at least for a left-brained engineer that has failed at all other forms of art.

## How Does it work.

Assembly allows you to not so much draw or create images but *assemble* them.  It gives you a bunch of geometric shapes. That you combine, arrange, and color them to create your master piece.

In this example, the image on the right is created exclusively from the shapes on the left.  The cloud, the most complicated shape, is composed of an oval surrounded by a bunch of small circles.  These shapes together with appropriate colors form the image if the rising sun.  As simple as this picture is I do not think I could have done it without the restrictions placed on what I can do that assembly enforces.  As strange as it sounds because of my lack of artistic ability restrictions make it easier for me.  When I am handed a blank piece of paper and a pencil, I have no idea what to do.  But, when I am looking at the shapes that assembly provides.  I can start to see how to build the bigger image in my mind from the smaller shapes.

Once the shapes are in place, you can choose the colors for them.  When you create a new project, it generates a color palette for you that is your starting point.  The colors are only a starting point, they can be changed at anytime to color you like.

However, you can only save five colors for later use.  I wish you could save more.  If you have more than five colors in your image, you can use the dropper tool to get the exact color from a shape and use it again.  But, this is a slow process.  So far, in the simple pictures I have created I have not run into this limitation.  However, ever time a choice a color it nags in the back of my mind wondering when I will run into this limitation.

Once you have added a shape and chosen its colors, you can duplicate, rotate, mirror (horizontally) and move the shape up or down the stack. These commands combined with moving and resizing are the tools you use to get your masterpiece.  

I am using Assembly on an iPad Pro with a pencil.  While the Apple pencil is nice, it is not a must have.  It does allow for some more fine grain control with less zooming.  But, if you do not mind zooming in you can get similar control with just your finger. 

## Conclusion

So there are a couple of areas that I would change.  But, I have and do enjoy using it and plan to keep using it. I have no problems recommending it to anybody who wants to try a new way of drawing.  So since it is free get out there give it a try and enjoy this new world of art creation.

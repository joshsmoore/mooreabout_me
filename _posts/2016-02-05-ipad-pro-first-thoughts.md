I got my iPad Pro today.  I got it to be my personal computer.  You might be wondering how a full-time programmer can use an iPad Pro as a personal computer, and the answer is I cannot.  Well, I cannot do it for writing code.  But, writing code is only part of what do with a computer.  The other part is family finances, writing blog entries, photo management, web browsing, etc.  As I was thinking about the many other things I use a computer for I determined that an iPad Pro would work fine.  Personally, when it comes to using a computer it goes past the functionality, and I ask myself do I enjoy the iOS experience?  The thing is the iPad experience just makes me happy.  I had been doing a lot of the before mentioned tasks on my iPad Air 2 and just really enjoyed the experience.  I will quote Myke Hurley to better express my feelings.

## Initial Impressions, Screen

I got the 128GB cellular model with the Smart Keyboard (the pencil is still back ordered in Taiwan).  The first thing I thought, just like everybody else, is that it is huge.  While I know it is the same size as my wife's old 13in MacBook, not having the keyboard in front of it just makes that screen look enormous.  It is also beautiful.  The picture-in-picture feature is amazing.  I have tried picture-in-picture on the iPad Air 2 and I thought well it is OK.  The picture is just too small to be enjoyable.  But, I am watching the Martian as I type this and the picture-in-picture is great.  It is large enough that when I look at it, I can see what is going on with no problem and just feels good, talking about movies watching movies full-screen is also amazing.  It is worlds different from the iPad Air 2 screen.  Those 3 inches make all the difference for movies in my opinion.

My initial impressions of split view on the iPad Pro are extremely positive.  Whenever I used split screen on the iPad Air (which I did a lot) it always felt crampt to me.  While it is not a 27in cinema display, it is also not cramped anymore.  I feel like I can use split screen without sacrificing productivity.  While using split screen on the iPad Air was a performance boost over a single application.  I felt that splitting the screen, especially into 1/2 size, made the first app less productive as it switched back into the smaller size factor.  The large iPad Pro screen can keep an app in full size mode even while only taking up 1/2 of the screen.

The on-screen keyboard is different.  I think in the end I will be able to make better time with it than the iPad Air keyboard.  But, until then I am always hitting the delete key or accidentally changing the language.  I need to build my muscle memory for the new layout. But, I think overall it will be much better for typing than the iPad Air keyboard, once I get used to it.  

## Smart Keyboard

Why did I get the smart keyboard?  At best the reviews are mixed.  Honestly, it came down to three simple reasons

1. I knew I wanted a real keyboard.
2. I wanted an iPad, not a laptop, which I feel is what you get when you use a bigger keyboard case like the Logitech CREATE.
3. I wanted to be able to remove the keyboard at any time with no hassle since I read a lot on the iPad.

My thoughts so far are positive.  The key travel is different, but I will get used to that.  The only big hangup that I have so far is using the modifier keys.  Because of the short keyboard travel, my brain is convinced that I have not pressed the button.  So I keep trying to press down harder and harder even though I have already pressed it.  Also, this might just be me; I think that some of the keys take different amounts of pressure to push. I notice it most when I need to extend my fingers to hit a key, like the plus or the tilde key.  So it could just be that the angle is different.  One thing I do not like is the watch mode.  If I touch the screen, it wobbles so much that it feels unstable.   I know there has always been a little wobble in the smart covers but this is far worse.  So I do not like using it unless I am just watching a movie and not interacting with the iPad at all.  All in all though I personally think it is a good product and a great start.  I hope the next iteration will be even better.


## Other thoughts

With the iPad Pro, like Texas, everything is bigger.  This even includes a really long lighting cable; I mean really *long*.  I am looking forward to working on it for both productivity and pleasure.  I plan to report in occasionally to let everybody know how it is going and what I am personally accomplishing on my iPad Pro.
